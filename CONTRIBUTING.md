How To Contribute

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and BlinkyTape is no different.

Here are a few hints and rules to get you started:

* Add yourself to the AUTHORS.md file in an alphabetical fashion. Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.
* No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
* Obey PEP 8 and PEP 257.
* Write good commit messages.
* Ideally, squash your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

Note

If you have something great but aren’t sure whether it adheres -- or even can adhere -- to the rules above: please submit a pull request anyway!

In the best case, we can mold it into something, in the worst case the pull request gets politely closed. There’s absolutely nothing to fear.

Thank you for considering to contribute to BlinkyTape!
